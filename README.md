# optimise_hwns_recall

HWNS comes with different parameters to construct your vector search performance.
ef, ef_constructions, M

It uses k-nearest-neighbours to create indexes for the data you want to search for.

The general idea is to have a recall that is 0.9 or higher. To always find the best possible result.

This repo helps to configure those values to optimise you vector db creation and optimise for search
